# This file contains the mapping of directory names to package names for
# documentation purposes. Each non-blank non-comment line is a two-element
# list that says a possible name of directory (multiple lines may be needed
# because of capitalization issues) and the documentation name of the package
# to match. Pseudo-numeric suffixes are interpreted as version numbers.
